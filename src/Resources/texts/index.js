We had a hay bale target range in back that we directed a growing arsenal of projectile weapons at. If we weren’t shooting targets and building forts, we were hiking around the hills or swimming in the lake. We had bows, crossbows, bb guns, 22’s and paint ball guns but the slingshot was tops. ",

I’ve been wiping out and getting sunburned ever since. Sadly I’m not the most talented surfer. I don’t like the feel or look of a full helmet. So I decided to make something in between no protection and reasonable protection that looks like a hat.",
